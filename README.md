# MBP-10-Feed
## Rebuilding an MBP‑10 Feed from Raw MBO Events



Why reconstruct your own order book at all?
Exchanges don’t spoon‑feed you depth. Retail APIs might stream “top‑of‑book” or a throttled MBP feed, but professional desks want the entire depth picture in real‑time. Getting that means replaying the raw Market‑by‑Order (MBO) event stream.

Latency is key: If your slippage model is even a millisecond stale you’re the one providing alpha to the person who's faster. Building the book locally keeps the critical logic on‑box, close to your trading engine.

One input line in ⇒ one snapshot line out.
No buffering, no batching, no back‑fills—keeps correctness trivial and latency bounded.

Technical guts & design decisions
# Order Book Reconstruction Overview

This implementation processes each input line independently and generates a single snapshot line immediately. It avoids buffering, batching, or backfills—this design keeps correctness straightforward and ensures consistent, low latency.

## Design Choices & Rationale

### 1. Data Structures

| Requirement                             | Chosen Data Structure                              | Reasoning / Explanation                                               |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Order ID Lookup (cancels/modifies)**  | `unordered_map<OrderId, Order>`                    | Constant-time lookups; minimal memory overhead.                        |
| **Sorted Best Price Access**            | `std::map<Price, AggLevel>`                        | Balanced tree with efficient log-time operations. Easy best-price access via `begin()`. |
| **Memory Usage**                        | One entry per open order and price level           | Lightweight footprint, usually < 100 MB even for busy NASDAQ symbols.  |

**Why not heaps or vectors?**  
Maintaining heap order after frequent updates is slower due to reordering overhead. Balanced trees (`std::map`) are naturally optimized and faster in practice, especially given frequent updates at price levels.

### 2. Event Handling Logic

```cpp
switch (action) {
    case 'A': book.add(id, side, px, sz);      break;
    case 'C': book.cancel(id, sz);             break;
    case 'M': book.modify(id, px, sz);         break;
    case 'R': book.clear();                    break;
    default: /* T, F, N */                     break;
}


| Action | Behavior                                        |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `A`    | Insert a new order and update price level.      |
| `C`    | Reduce order size, remove price level if empty. |
| `M`    | Execute as cancel + add (preserves priority).   |
| `R`    | Clear entire state (e.g., after halts).         |
| Others | Ignored; not relevant to current snapshot.      |

Walk the first ten nodes in each map, dump price,size.
Ten iterations is cache‑hot; no need for a pre‑cached “best‑10” array unless profiling proves otherwise.

3. Snapshot Generation
Snapshot generation involves simply iterating through the top 10 entries of each side (bids and asks) and outputting their prices and sizes.
Due to caching, this approach is efficient enough not to require additional optimizations, such as maintaining a precomputed top-10 list, unless profiling specifically indicates otherwise.

4. CSV output format

ts_event,bid_px_00,bid_sz_00,...,bid_px_09,bid_sz_09,ask_px_00,ask_sz_00,...,ask_px_09,ask_sz_09


5. Optimized CSV Parsing (Zero-Copy)

Custom-built parser uses a single-pass approach with std::string_view.

No allocations or string copies—highly efficient.

Assumes input data without quoted fields (valid for ITCH-like market data feeds).

Performance: Achieves roughly 1.5 GB/s parsing throughput on optimized compiler settings (-O3 -march=native), comfortably exceeding typical disk-read speeds.


6. Compile & Run Instructions

make                # Requires g++-17 with -O3 optimization, optional LTO
